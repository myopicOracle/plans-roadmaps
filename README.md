So I make plan to make less hard. Then I put here.

## This repo currently contains the following plans:
### Learn React (Daily Breakdowns, Project-Based)
- Learn React with Theory and Projects in 28 Days
- Assumed daily commitment: 6 hours
- Level of Detail: 9/10
- Theory structured around The Odin Project & Full Stack Open
- Code is very specific, with step-by-step and solution code
- Builds several projects progressively over the 28 days
- Cons: If pure theory, could knock this out in half the time
- Pros: Learn the fundamentals well, so it can serve you in other JS/React libraries and frameworks
- Note: These projects are not intended to serve as portfolio pieces, but you can always upscale
